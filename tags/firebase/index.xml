      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m building a service that requires user authentication. The primary endpoint is a gRPC-based service. I would like to consider using certificate-based auth but this feels&amp;hellip; challenging. Instead, I have been aware of, but never used, Firebase Authentication and was interested to see that Cloud Endpoints includes Firebase Authentication as one of its supported auth mechanisms. Curiosity piqued, I confirmed that gRPC supports Google token-based authentication.
The following is a summary of what I did but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the extensive documentation to Google, (Google&amp;rsquo;s) Firebase and gRPC, all of which, in this case, provide really good explanations.</description>
