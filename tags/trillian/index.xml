      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally being able to hack my way through to a working Rust gRPC client (for PyPi Transparency).
It&amp;rsquo;s not very good: poorly structured, hacky etc. but it serves the purpose of giving me a foothold into Rust development so that I can evolve it as I learn the language and its practices.
There are several Rust crates (SDK) for gRPC. There&amp;rsquo;s no sanctioned SDK for Rust on grpc.io.
I chose stepancheg&amp;rsquo;s grpc-rust because it&amp;rsquo;s a pure Rust implementation (not built atop the C implementation).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been noodling around with another Trillian personality.
Another in a theme that interests me in providing tamperproof logs for the packages in the popular package management registries.
The Golang team recently announced Go Module Mirror which is built atop Trillian. It seems to me that all the package registries (Go Modules, npm, Maven, NuGet etc.) would benefit from tamperproof logs hosted by a trusted 3rd-party.
As you may have guessed, PyPi Transparency is a log for PyPi packages.</description>

      <description>The goal of pypi-transparency is very similar to the underlying motivation for the Golang team&amp;rsquo;s Checksum Database (also built with Trillian).
Even though, PyPi provides hashes of the content of packages it hosts, the developer must trust that PyPi&amp;rsquo;s data is consistent. One ambition with pypi-transparency is to provide a companion, tamperproof log of PyPi package files in order to provide a double-check of these hashes.
It is important to understand what this does (and does not) provide.</description>
