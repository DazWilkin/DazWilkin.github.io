      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about Ackal&amp;rsquo;s use of Firestore and subscribing to Firestore document CRUD events:&#xA;Routing Firestore events to GKE with Eventarc Cloud Firestore Triggers in Golang using Firestore triggers I find Google&amp;rsquo;s Eventarc documentation to be confusing and, in typical Google fashion, even though open-sourced, you often need to do some legwork to find relevant sources, viz:&#xA;Google&amp;rsquo;s Protobufs for Eventarc (using cloudevents) google-cloudevents1 Convenience (since you can generate these using protoc) language-specific types generated from the above e.</description>

I was unable to JSON marshal the rust generated by tonic for such a message.</description>
