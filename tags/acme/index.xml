      <description>Last year, I wrote about using Automatic Certs w/ Golang gRPC service on Compute Engine. That solution uses ACME with (the wonderful) Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. Google is offering a private preview of Automate Public Certificates Lifecycle Management via RFC 8555 (ACME) and, because I&amp;rsquo;m using Google Cloud Platform extensively to build a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; and I think it would be useful to have a backup to Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give the solution a try.</description>

      <description>I needed to deploy a healthcheck-enabled gRPC TLS-enabled service. Fortunately, most (all?) of the SDKs include an implementation, e.g. Golang has grpc-go/health.&#xA;I learned in my travels that:&#xA;DigitalOcean [App] platform does not (link) work with TLS-based gRPC apps. Fly has a regression (link) that breaks gRPC So, I resorted to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Although Cloud Run would be well-suited to running the gRPC app, it uses a proxy|sidecar to provision a cert for the app and I wanted to be able to (easily use a custom domain) and give myself a somewhat general-purpose solution.</description>
