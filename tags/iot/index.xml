      <description>ESPHome is a very interesting project. I&amp;rsquo;d not heard of it until this week and am surprised that it isn&amp;rsquo;t more newsworthy.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m always tinkering with IoT stuff, have a couple of Wemos D1 ESP8266s. They are brought out occasionally for learning. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them this week with ESPHome. I&amp;rsquo;m looking to buy some Xiaomi BLE temperature sensors and thinking I could read the temperatures from these using the ESPs (thanks to ESPHome) and publish the data to MQTT.</description>
