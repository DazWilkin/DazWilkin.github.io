      <description>Recently, I wrote about some initial adventures with OriginStamp
Using OriginStamp&amp;rsquo;s UI or API, submitting a hash results in transactions being submitted to Bitcoin, Ethereum and a German newspaper.
Using the API, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to query OriginStamp&amp;rsquo;s service for a proof. This post explains how to verify such a proof.
The diligent reader among you (Hey Mom!) will recall that I submitted a hash for the message:
Frederik Jack is a bubbly Border Collie The SHA-256 hash of this message is:</description>

      <description>I wrote recently about some exploration of Timestamping with OriginStamp. Since writing that post, I had some supportive feedback from the helpful folks at OriginStamp and plan to continue exploring that solution.
Meanwhile, OriginStamp exposed me to timestamping and trusted timestamping and I discovered freeTSA.org.
What&amp;rsquo;s the point? These services provide authoritative proof of the existence of a digital asset before some point in time; OriginStamp provides a richer service and uses multiple timestamp authorities including Bitcoin, Ethereum and rather interestingly a German Newspaper&amp;rsquo;s Trusted Timestamp.</description>

      <description>A friend mentioned OriginStamp to me.
NB There are 2 sites: originstamp.com and originstamp.org.
It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting project.
It&amp;rsquo;s a solution for providing auditable proof that you had a(ccess to) some digital thing before a certain date. OriginStamp provides user-|developer-friendly means to submit files|hashes (of your content) and have these bundled into transactions that are submitted to e.g. bitcoin.
I won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to duplicate the narrative here, review OriginStamp&amp;rsquo;s site and some of its content.</description>
