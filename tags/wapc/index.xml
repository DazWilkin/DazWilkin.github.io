      <description>As my reader will know (Hey Mom!), I&amp;rsquo;ve been noodling around with WASM and waPC. I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring ways to pass structured messages across the host:guest boundary.
Protobufs was my first choice. @KevinHoffman created waPC and waSCC and he explained to me and that wSCC uses Message Pack.
It&amp;rsquo;s slightly surprising to me (still) that technologies like this exist with everyone else seemingly using them and I&amp;rsquo;ve not heard of them.</description>

      <title>Remotely invoking WASM functions using gRPC and waPC</title>

      <description>Following on from waPC &amp;amp; Protobufs, I can now remotely invoke (arbitrary) WASM functions:
Client:
The logging isn&amp;rsquo;t perfectly clear but, the client gets (a previously added) WASM binary from the server (using the SHA-256 of the WASM binary as a unique identifier). The result includes metadata that includes a protobuf descriptor of the WASM binary&amp;rsquo;s functions. The descriptor defines gRPC services (that represent the WASM functions) with input (parameters) and output (results) messages.</description>

      <title>WASM Cloud Functions</title>

      <description>Following on from waPC &amp;amp; Protobufs and a question on Stack Overflow about Cloud Functions, I was compelled to try running WASM on Cloud Functions no JavaScript.
I wanted to reuse the WASM waPC functions that I&amp;rsquo;d written in Rust as described in the other post. Cloud Functions does not (yet!?) provide a Rust runtime and so I&amp;rsquo;m using the waPC Host for Go in this example.
It works!
PARAMS=$(printf &amp;#39;{&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;:{&amp;#34;real&amp;#34;:39,&amp;#34;imag&amp;#34;:3},&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;:{&amp;#34;real&amp;#34;:39,&amp;#34;imag&amp;#34;:3}}&amp;#39; | base64) TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token) echo &amp;#34;{ \&amp;#34;filename\&amp;#34;:\&amp;#34;complex.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m hacking around with a solution that combines WASM and Google Trillian.
Ultimately, I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to ship WASM (binaries) to a Trillian personality and then invoke (exported) functions on them. Some this was borne from the interesting exploration of Krustlet and its application of wascc.
I&amp;rsquo;m still booting into WASM but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting technology that has most interesting potential outside the browser. Some folks have been trailblazing the technology and I have been reading Kevin Hoffman&amp;rsquo;s medium and wascc (nee waxosuit) work.</description>
