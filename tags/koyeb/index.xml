      <description>Ackal deploys gRPC Health Checking clients in locations around the World in order to health check services that are representative of customer need.&#xA;Koyeb offers multiple locations and I spent time today writing a client for Ackal to integrate with Koyeb using the Golang client for the Koyeb API.&#xA;The SDK is generated from Koyeb&amp;rsquo;s OpenAPI (nee Swagger) endpoint using openapi-generator-cli. This is a smart, programmatic solution to ensuring that the SDK always matches the API definition but I found the result is idiosyncratic and therefore a little gnarly.</description>

      <description>Yet another cloud platform exporter for resource|cost management. This time for Koyeb with Koyeb Exporter.&#xA;Deploying resources to cloud platforms generally incurs cost based on the number of resources deployed, the time each resource is deployed and the cost (per period of time) that the resource is deployed. It is useful to be able to automatically measure and alert on all the resources deployed on all the platforms that you&amp;rsquo;re using and this is an intent of these exporters.</description>
