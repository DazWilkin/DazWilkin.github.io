      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time writing Bash scripts and a web site but neither has been sufficiently creative that I&amp;rsquo;ve felt worth a blog post.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve been finalizing the web site, I needed an Issue Tracker and decided to leverage GitHub(&amp;rsquo;s Issues).
As a former Googler, I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with Google&amp;rsquo;s (excellent) internal issue tracking tool (Buganizer) and it&amp;rsquo;s public manifestation Issue Tracker. Google documents Issue Tracker and its Issue type which I&amp;rsquo;ve mercilessly plagiarized in my implementation.</description>

      <description>This is very useful:
I am building an application that comprises multiple repos. I continue to procrastinate on whether using multiple repos vs. a monorepo was a good idea but, an issue that I have (had) is the need to ensure that the repos&amp;rsquo; contents are using current|latest modules. GitHub can help.
Most of the application is written in Golang with a smattering of Rust and some JavaScript.
Aside Even though I&amp;rsquo;m more proficient with Golang, I want to become more proficient in Rust and I contemplated trying to write the entire application in Rust.</description>

      <title>GitHub Actions &amp;&amp; GitHub Container Registry</title>

      <description>You know when you start something and then regret it!? I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be sticking with Google Cloud Build; GitHub Actions appears functional and useful but I found the documentation to be confusing and limited and struggled to get a simple container image build|push working.
I&amp;rsquo;ve long used Docker Hub but am planning to use it less as a result of the planned changes. I want to see Docker succeed and to do so it needs to find a way to make money but, there are free alternatives including the new GitHub Container Registry and the very very cheap Google Container Registry.</description>
