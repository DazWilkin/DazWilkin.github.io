      <description>This is very useful:
I am building an application that comprises multiple repos. I continue to procrastinate on whether using multiple repos vs. a monorepo was a good idea but, an issue that I have (had) is the need to ensure that the repos&#39; contents are using current|latest modules. GitHub can help.
Most of the application is written in Golang with a smattering of Rust and some JavaScript.
 Aside Even though I&amp;rsquo;m more proficient with Golang, I want to become more proficient in Rust and I contemplated trying to write the entire application in Rust.</description>

      <description>I think it would be valuable if Google were to provide volumes in Cloud Build of package registries (e.g. Go Modules; PyPi; Maven; NPM etc.).
Google provides a mirror of a subset of Docker Hub. This confers several benefits: Google&amp;rsquo;s imprimatur; speed (latency); bandwidth; and convenience.
The same benefits would apply to package registries.
In the meantime, there&amp;rsquo;s a hacky way to gain some of the benefits of these when using Cloud Build.</description>
