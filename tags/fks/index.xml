      <description>Interested to explore Fly Kubernetes after being accepted into the closed beta.&#xA;The folks at Fly are innovative in their technology uses and, having been a long-time Kubernetes user, I was intrigued to learn that Fly.io has implemented Kubernetes atop Fly.&#xA;My first Deployment failed:&#xA;Authentication required to access image &amp;#34;ghcr.io/{image}&amp;#34; It was confirmed to me that FKS does not support pulling from private registries. The solution is pull-tag-push images to registry.</description>
