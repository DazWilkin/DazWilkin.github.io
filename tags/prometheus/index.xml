      <title>Prometheus Protobufs and Native Histograms</title>

      <description>I responded to a question Prometheus metric protocol buffer in gRPC on Stackoverflow and it piqued my curiosity and got me yak shaving.&#xA;Prometheus used to support two exposition formats including Protocol Buffers, then dropped Protocol Buffer and has since re-added it (see Protobuf format). The Protobuf format has returned to support the experimental Native Histograms feature.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in adding Native Histogram support to Ackal so thought I&amp;rsquo;d learn more about this metric.</description>

      <description>The deployment of Kube State Metrics for Google Managed Prometheus creates both a PodMonitoring and ClusterPodMonitoring.&#xA;The PodMonitoring resource exposes metrics published on metric-self port (8081).&#xA;The ClusterPodMonitoring exposes metrics published on metric port (8080) but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t include cronjob-related metrics:&#xA;kubectl get clusterpodmonitoring/kube-state-metrics \ --output=jsonpath=&amp;#34;{.spec.endpoints[0].metricRelabeling}&amp;#34; \ | jq -r .

      <description>For ackalctld to be deployable to Kubernetes with Prometheus Operator, it is necessary to Enable ScrapeConfig to use (discovery|target) proxies #5966. While I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with Kubernetes, Kubernetes operators (Ackal uses one built with the Operator SDK) and Prometheus Operator, I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with developing Prometheus Operator. This (and subsequent) posts will document some preliminary work on this.&#xA;Cloned Prometheus Operator&#xA;Branched scrape-config-url-proxy&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m unsure how to effect these changes and unsure whether documentation exists.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Enable ScrapeConfig to use (discovery|target) proxies&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a companion, local daemon (called ackalctld) for Ackal that provides a functionally close version of the service.&#xA;One way to deploy ackalctld is to use Kubernetes and it would be convenient if the Prometheus metrics were scrapeable by Prometheus Operator.&#xA;In order for this to work, Prometheus Operator needs to be able to scrape Google Cloud Run targets because ackalctld creates Cloud Run services for its health check clients.</description>

      <description>Yet another cloud platform exporter for resource|cost management. This time for Koyeb with Koyeb Exporter.&#xA;Deploying resources to cloud platforms generally incurs cost based on the number of resources deployed, the time each resource is deployed and the cost (per period of time) that the resource is deployed. It is useful to be able to automatically measure and alert on all the resources deployed on all the platforms that you&amp;rsquo;re using and this is an intent of these exporters.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on an efficiency drive with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring.&#xA;With regards Cloud Logging, I&amp;rsquo;m contemplating (!) eliminating almost all log storage. As it is I&amp;rsquo;ve buzz cut log storage with a _Default sink that has comprehensive sets of NOT LOG_ID(X) inclusion and exclusion filters. As I was doing so, I began to wonder why I need to pay for the storage of much logging. There&amp;rsquo;s the comfort from knowing that everything you may ever need is being logged (at least for 30 days) but there&amp;rsquo;s also the costs that that entails.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written Prometheus Exporters for various cloud platforms. My motivation for writing these Exporters is that I want a unified mechanism to track my usage of these platform&amp;rsquo;s services. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to deploy a service on a platform and inadvertently leave it running (up a bill). The set of exporters is:&#xA;Prometheus Exporter for Azure Prometheus Exporter for Fly.io Prometheus Exporter for GCP Prometheus Exporter for Linode Prometheus Exporter for Vultr This post describes the recently-added Azure Exporter which only provides metrics for Container Apps and Resource Groups.</description>

      <description>Ackal uses a Kubernetes Operator to orchestrate the lifecycle of its health checks. Ackal&amp;rsquo;s Operator is written in Go using kubebuilder.&#xA;Yesterday, my interest was piqued by a MetalBear blog post Writing a Kubernetes Operator [in Rust]. I spent some time reimplementing one of Ackal&amp;rsquo;s CRDs (Check) using kube-rs and not only refreshed my Rust knowledge but learned a bunch more about Kubernetes and Operators.&#xA;While rummaging around the Kubernetes documentation, I discovered flant&amp;rsquo;s Shell-operator and spent some time today exploring its potential.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Google Managed Service for Prometheus (GMP) and liking it.&#xA;Sometime ago, I tried using PromLens with GMP but GMP&amp;rsquo;s Prometheus HTTP API endpoint requires auth and I&amp;rsquo;ve battled Prometheus&amp;rsquo; somewhat limited auth mechanism before (Scraping metrics exposed by Google Cloud Run services that require authentication).&#xA;Listening to PromCon EU 2022 videos, I learned that PromLens has been open sourced and contributed to the Prometheus project. Eventually, the functionality of PromLens should be combined into the Prometheus UI.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a solution (gcp-oidc-token-proxy) that can be used in conjunction with Prometheus OAuth2 to authenticate requests so that Prometheus can scrape metrics exposed by e.g. Cloud Run services that require authentication.

      <description>Google Cloud Run is useful but, each service is limited to exposing a single port. This caused me problems with a gRPC service that serves (non-gRPC) Prometheus metrics because customarily, you would serve gRPC on one port and the Prometheus metrics on another.&#xA;Fortunately, cmux provides a solution by providing a mechanism that multiplexes both services (gRPC and HTTP) on a single port!&#xA;TL;DR See the cmux Limitations and use:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project that will programmatically create Google Cloud Run services and I want to be able to dynamically discover these services using Prometheus.&#xA;This is one solution.&#xA;NOTE Google Cloud Run is the service I&amp;rsquo;m using, but the principle described herein applies to any runtime service that you&amp;rsquo;d wish to use.&#xA;Why is this challenging? IIUC, it&amp;rsquo;s primarily because Prometheus has a limited set of plugins for service discovery, see the sections that include _sd_ in Prometheus Configuration documentation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m obsessing over Prometheus exporters. First came Linode Exporter, then GCP Exporter and, on Sunday, I stumbled upon a reverse-engineered API for Google Home devices and so wrote a very basic Google Home SDK and a similarly basic Google Home Exporter:&#xA;The SDK only implements /setup/eureka_info and then only some of the returned properties. There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of metric-like data to use besides SignalLevel (signal_level) and NoiseLevel (noise_level). I&amp;rsquo;m not clear on the meaning of some of the properties.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week I discussed a Linode Prometheus Exporter.&#xA;I added metrics for Digital Ocean&amp;rsquo;s Managed Kubernetes service to @metalmatze&amp;rsquo;s Digital Ocean Exporter.&#xA;This left, metrics for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) which has, for many years, been my primary cloud platform. So, today I wrote Prometheus Exporter for Google Cloud Platform.&#xA;All 3 of these exporters follow the template laid down by @metalmatze and, because each of these services has a well-written Golang SDK, it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward to implement an exporter for each of them.</description>

      <description>I enjoy using Prometheus and have toyed around with it for some time particularly in combination with Kubernetes. I signed up with Linode [referral] compelled by the addition of a managed Kubernetes service called Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE). I have an anxiety that I&amp;rsquo;ll inadvertently leave resources running (unused) on a cloud platform. Instead of refreshing the relevant billing page, it struck me that Prometheus may (not yet proven) help.</description>
