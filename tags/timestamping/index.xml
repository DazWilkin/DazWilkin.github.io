      <description>Recently, I wrote about some initial adventures with OriginStamp
Using OriginStamp&amp;rsquo;s UI or API, submitting a hash results in transactions being submitted to Bitcoin, Ethereum and a German newspaper.
Using the API, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to query OriginStamp&amp;rsquo;s service for a proof. This post explains how to verify such a proof.

      <description>I wrote recently about some exploration of Timestamping with OriginStamp. Since writing that post, I had some supportive feedback from the helpful folks at OriginStamp and plan to continue exploring that solution.
Meanwhile, OriginStamp exposed me to timestamping and trusted timestamping and I discovered freeTSA.org.
What&amp;rsquo;s the point? These services provide authoritative proof of the existence of a digital asset before some point in time; OriginStamp provides a richer service and uses multiple timestamp authorities including Bitcoin, Ethereum and rather interestingly a German Newspaper&amp;rsquo;s Trusted Timestamp.</description>
