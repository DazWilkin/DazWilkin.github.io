      <description>A friend mentioned OriginStamp to me.
NB There are 2 sites: originstamp.com and originstamp.org.
It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting project.
It&amp;rsquo;s a solution for providing auditable proof that you had a(ccess to) some digital thing before a certain date. OriginStamp provides user-|developer-friendly means to submit files|hashes (of your content) and have these bundled into transactions that are submitted to e.g. bitcoin.
I won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to duplicate the narrative here, review OriginStamp&amp;rsquo;s site and some of its content.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been noodling around with another Trillian personality.
Another in a theme that interests me in providing tamperproof logs for the packages in the popular package management registries.
The Golang team recently announced Go Module Mirror which is built atop Trillian. It seems to me that all the package registries (Go Modules, npm, Maven, NuGet etc.) would benefit from tamperproof logs hosted by a trusted 3rd-party.
As you may have guessed, PyPi Transparency is a log for PyPi packages.</description>
