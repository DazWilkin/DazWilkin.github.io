      <description>I wrote recently about some exploration of Timestamping with OriginStamp. Since writing that post, I had some supportive feedback from the helpful folks at OriginStamp and plan to continue exploring that solution.&#xA;Meanwhile, OriginStamp exposed me to timestamping and trusted timestamping and I discovered freeTSA.org.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s the point? These services provide authoritative proof of the existence of a digital asset before some point in time; OriginStamp provides a richer service and uses multiple timestamp authorities including Bitcoin, Ethereum and rather interestingly a German Newspaper&amp;rsquo;s Trusted Timestamp.</description>
