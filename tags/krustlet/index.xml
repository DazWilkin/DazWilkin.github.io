      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent time this week returning to the interesting Deislabs project Krustlet. Since the last time, the bootstrapping process has been simplified using Kubernetes Bootstrap Tokens. I know this updated process works with MicroK8s. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m struggling with it on GKE and thought I&amp;rsquo;d try DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes.&#xA;It worked first time!&#xA;In the following, we run both the Kubernetes cluster and the Krustlet Droplet on DigitalOcean but, as long as the cluster and the VM are able to communicate with one another, you should be able to run these anywhere.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m hacking around with a solution that combines WASM and Google Trillian.&#xA;Ultimately, I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to ship WASM (binaries) to a Trillian personality and then invoke (exported) functions on them. Some this was borne from the interesting exploration of Krustlet and its application of wascc.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m still booting into WASM but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting technology that has most interesting potential outside the browser. Some folks have been trailblazing the technology and I have been reading Kevin Hoffman&amp;rsquo;s medium and wascc (nee waxosuit) work.</description>
